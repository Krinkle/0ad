# 0 A.D.

0 A.D. (pronounced "zero ey-dee") is a free, open-source, cross-platform
real-time strategy game of ancient warfare.

This is currently an incomplete, under-development version of the game.
We're always interested in getting more people involved, to help bring the game
towards completion and to share the interesting experience of developing a
project of this scope.
